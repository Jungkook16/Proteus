Theory
UART (stands for Universal Asynchronous Reception andTransmission). It is a simple serial
communication protocol that allows the host to communicate with the other devices. It has two data
lines, one to transmit (TX) and another to receive (RX). For different embedded devices, youwill
need to check on the datasheets to understand which pins can be used for UART.

Material
Proteus 8, Arduino IDE, Arduino UNO Library, Virtual Terminal.


Method
1. Open Proteus 8, click on the P button (Pick a device), search for Arduino and add
Arduino UNO to the simulating area.
2. Go the virtual instruments mode on the left side menu and add virtual terminal to the
simulating area
3. Click on the pins of the components and connect them as shown below
4. Now open Arduino IDE, go to file menu > Examples > Basic >DigitalReadSerial this will
open up the following code
1. Run this file and copy the hex file path from the console.
Note: if .hex path is not shown then click on file preferences and select the
compileand upload checkboxes and click on ok and re run the code.
2. Now on Proteus 8, click on Arduino and in program file field, paste the copied hex file
path.

CODE:
void setup(){
Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop(){
Serial.println("Hello from UART");
delay(1);
}

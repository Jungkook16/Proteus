Theory
- Vibration can be defined as the mechanical oscillation about an equilibrium position of a
machine or component or simply the back and forth motion of a machine or component.

Material
- Vibration Sensor (Vibration SW-420), LED-yellow, Logic toggle, GROUND, POWER.

Method
1. In Proteus 8, import the required components from pick a device, i.e. the vibration sensor
and logic toggle.
2. Drag and drop those components to the simulating area.
3. Go to the Terminal section and drag 2 GROUND and a POWER component.
4. Connect the GND of vibration sensor board to the GROUND and POWER to the Vcc.
5. Drag the buzzer and connect one of its pin to OUT of vibration board and the other pin of
buzzer to the 2
nd GROUND.
6. Now connect the Logic toggle to the test pin of vibration sensor.
7. The circuit should be similar to the image above.
8. Load the Hex file by clicking on vibration sensor and browse to where the HEX file is
located and press play.
9. Click on the toggle button to hear the buzzer sound.
